There are sixteen 64-bit registers in x86-64: %rax , %rbx , %rcx , %rdx , %rdi , %rsi , %rbp , %rsp , and %r8-r15 . Of these, %rax , %rcx , %rdx , %rdi , %rsi , %rsp , and %r8-r11 are considered caller-save registers, meaning that they are not necessarily saved across function
calls. 
By convention, ==%rax is used to store a function’s return value==, if it exists and is no more than 64 bits long. (Larger return types like structs are returned using the stack.) Registers %rbx , %rbp , and %r12-r15 are callee-save registers, meaning that they are saved across function calls. 
Register %rsp is used as the _stack pointer_ , a pointer to the topmost element in the stack.
Additionally, ==%rdi , %rsi , %rdx , %rcx , %r8 , and %r9 are used to pass the first six integer or pointer parameters to called functions==. 
Additional parameters (or large parameters such as structs passed by value) are passed on the stack.
